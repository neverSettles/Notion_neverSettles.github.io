# LLAMA2D

In September I attended the AGI House SF's hackathon on launching your own 'custom llm'. The day started with some speakers from Ray, Gradient Ventures, and perhaps most surprisingly, [Kawal Ghandi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kgandhi/) from the office of the CTO at Google:

Many of the technical details can be found In my friend Rohan's [X post](https://x.com/khoomeik/status/1753511199877333254?s=20). 

[Rohan](https://rpandey.tech/)'s interests lie in Web Interaction Agents, so for me, this presented a great opportunity to get familiar with some of the popular webscraping tools ([playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python), [selenium](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selenium-python-tutorial/)). 

Overall we had a pretty fun time hacking together. We got a quick team picture in the middle of it all:
